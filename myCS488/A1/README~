Manual:
In the assignment is wasn't clear if the preset colours should be also reset after hitting R, I have made the assumption that is the desired effect.

I wasn't sure how the rotation was done so I have rotated the grid on the y axis while keeping the grid pointed at the centre.

In the assignment I was unclear about the placement of the cursor/active cell. I assumed that the active cell must be drawn on the grid on top of all the cubes because of the sentence: "The indicator is drawn on top of all other scene geometry"

The assignment wasn't clear on what a "reasonable" amount of rotation should be so I tuned the rotation so that if a user would to drag the mouse from left to right (or vice versa) on the window, it would rotate the grid approximately once.

The assignment wasn't clear if we should differentiate between dragging on the colour box or dragging for rotation.

The assignment didn't specify if we needed to rename the winow name to "Assignment 1", so I have left it alone.
